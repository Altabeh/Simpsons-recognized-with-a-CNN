# Identifying Simpson family members by training a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
First things first, we'd like to extend our appologies to Santa's Little Helper, Marge and Snowball II for not being
included in our classifier.   

## Dataset 

The credit of collecting and preparing the Simpsons characters goes to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-datasetdataset" title="alexattia">alexattia</a> from Kaggle.
We are going to use a more narrowed down version of this dataset which would be enough for our purposes in this repository <a name="*">1</a>.
